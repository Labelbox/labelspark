# LabelSpark Python SDK Contribution Guide


## Branches

* All development happens in per-feature branches prefixed by contributor's
  initials. For example `fs/feature_name`.
* Approved PRs are merged to the `develop` branch.
* The `develop` branch is merged to `master` on each release.


Forks and PRs welcomed.
